## KomodoHub Backend Service Setup

The KomodoHub backend is built with **Python 3.8**, **Flask**, **uWSGI**, and **MySQL**. Follow the steps below to set
up and run the server:

1. Ensure you're using **Python 3.8**.
2. Navigate to the `./backend/` directory.
    ```bash
    cd ./backend/
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   (Make sure to update the `requirements.txt` with any new libraries and versions when adding dependencies).

4. Ensure the MySQL database exists. If not, create it by running the following command in the MySQL client:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE  if not exists komodo_hub CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
    ```

5. For development purposes, run the application using:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6. For production, run the application with uWSGI:

    ```bash
    uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini
    ```

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main application file where the Flask app is initialized.
- `config.py`: Contains all configuration settings for the app, including the database URI and secret keys.
- `models.py`: Defines the database schema (tables and relationships).
- `routes.py`: Contains all the route definitions for the RESTful API.
- `uwsgi.ini`: Configuration for uWSGI to serve the app in production.
- `wsgi.py`: Entry point for the uWSGI server to run the Flask app.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.

**Note:**  
The `init.sql` file (located in the root directory) contains the full database schema with English comments.  
It serves as a reference structure and can be adapted based on business requirements.  
Tables may be added, modified, or removed as needed.
